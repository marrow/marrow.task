	# Explicitly calling. This is used internally by the runner. First positional argument is a Task instance
	# or the ObjectId of a Task instance, or None for local execution.  (This sets up the thread-local context

	# There are several things you can do with a task instance:
	receipt.wait()  # Wait forever for completion (of any kind).
	receipt.wait(30)  # Wait 30 seconds.
	
	# The completion messages contain the results, so waiting will update the local task instance with the result
	# or exception as appropriate, plus the waiting/running/completed/successful/failed times and thus booleans.

	# original exception and traceback, on Python 3 with one of those "while processing X exception, this other one
	# occurred".

	float(receipt)  # same
	bytes(receipt)  # same (though Python 2 compatibility means str()/unicode() differs slightly)
	
	receipt = count(10)
	list(receipt)  # same, piggy-backs on iteration
	
	# as long as the capped collection is large enough, reiteration should be A-OK
	for i in receipt:
		pass  # same, but progressively, as each yield is issued by the task
	
	# You can even use arbitrary dot-colon function references.

	# Task.retries  # The maximum number of retries.
	# Task.delay  # The number of seconds to wait before starting execution.
